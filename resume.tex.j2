% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the
% line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\location{Fall 2013 | Ann Arbor, MI}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Designed an embedded system utilizing a SOC to control a set of 4 RC cars
\item Mesh network to allow for inter-communication between all 4 cars
\item Use of IR to send directed information at other cars
\item Integration with popular Gamecube controller interface

\runsubsection{N-Way Superscalar OO Processor}
\descript{| Undergraduate Project}
\location{Winter 2014 | Ann Arbor, MI}
\begin{tightemize}

\item Created an out of order processor in System Verilog which was able to
attain a 12 ns clock period when operating at 3-ways, and executed 1.11
instructions per clock cycle on a specific test-bench
\item Used non-obvious optimizations to improve performance, such as a
heterogeneous cache size

\item Gained in-depth understanding of processor design and testing
\item Gained the best project grade in the class
