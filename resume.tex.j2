% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the
% line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.
%

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.

% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
%

% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
