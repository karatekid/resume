Tool to generate my resume.

I define most aspects in yaml in resume.yml. This is inserted into
resume.tex.j2 to produce resume.tex. That .tex file can then be inserted into
something like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to generate a pdf, or you
can generate whatever you'd like on your local computer.
