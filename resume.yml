      description:
        - Develop and maintain a microservice based architecture consisting of
          more than 250 separate python services to run an automated genetic
          sequencing lab that processes more than 1,000 samples a day.
        - Create drivers around several third-party instruments to provide a
          layer of abstraction from the various vendor specific
          implementations. Devices include centrifuge loaders, liquid handlers,
          St√§ubli robot arms, and thermal cyclers.
        - Collaborate with R\&D scientists and CLIA personnel to utilize our
          automation stack to create new protocols and optimize existing ones.
          For example, work I've done to parallelize our dna extraction
          protocol allows us to process at least 30\% more samples a day.
        - Provide modular UIs to lab scientists with the use of React
          components.
        - Lead software team to improve overall architecture and workflow by
          instituting a regular architecture meeting to discuss new ideas.
          # - PR protocol
          # - API usage and client separation
          # - React tooling with create-react-app
          # - Python packaging with Pipenv
          # - Recipe Server
        - Improve reliability of infrastructure by adding essential unit and
          integration tests as well as constantly improving the existing
          services.
          # - Optimize scheduling algorithms to improve the run time of
          #   biological processes

          #   - counting_sheep
          #   - pymake & pipenv
        - Created several solutions to standardize our tooling, such as pymake,
          a self-bootstrapping Makefile configuration tool.
        - Oversaw and assisted with a long-term migration project from an
          outdated architecture to a new one.

          query-url pairs to incorporate query-dependency into spam
          classification.
              # - Created a list of web-spam judgments from a set of query-url
              # pairs, resulting in approximately 32,000 judgments
              # - Accumulated an extensive feature set from a list of query-url
