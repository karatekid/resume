      description:
        - Development and maintenance of micro-service based architecture
          consisting of >250 separate python services.
        - Utilize this architecture to support an automated sequencing lab that
          processes more than 1,000 samples a day.
        - Create drivers around several third-party instruments to provide a
          layer of abstraction from the various vendor specific
          implementations. Devices include centrifuge loaders, liquid handlers,
          and thermal cyclers.
        - Work with R\&D scientists and CLIA personnel to utilize our
          automation stack to create new assays and optimize existing ones. For
          example, parallelizing our dna extraction process allows the lab to
          process at least 30% more samples a day.
        - Oversaw and assisted with a long-term migration project from an
          outdated architecture to a new one.
          # - Preamp 1.6
        - Provide modular UIs to lab scientists with the use of React
          components.
        - Guide software team to improve overall architecture and workflow by
          instituting a regular architecture meeting to discuss new ideas.
          # - PR protocol
          # - API usage and client separation
          # - React tooling with create-react-app
          # - Python packaging with Pipenv
          # - Recipe Server
        - Created several solutions to standardize our tooling, such as pymake,
          a self-bootstrapping Makefile configuration tool.
        - Improve reliability of infrastructure by adding essential unit and
          integration tests as well as constantly improving the existing
          services.

              # - Created a list of web-spam judgments from a set of query-url
              # pairs, resulting in approximately 32,000 judgments
              # - Accumulated an extensive feature set from a list of query-url
              # pairs, utilizing existing resources that were part of an
              # elaborate codebase
        - Trained a classifier on features generated from a database of
          query-url pairs to incorporate query-dependency into spam
          classification.

          # - Resolved several bugs with their code base and added different
          # small functionalities
        - Created a web scraper bookmarklet in JavaScript to grab specific
          product information irrelevant of domain
        - Integrated that information with the existing site to both cement and
          expand their business model
          # - Created a job that can be run continuously to update that product
          # information
